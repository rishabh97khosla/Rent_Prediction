# Rent Prediction
 
Here is our first dig at a machine learning project 

The aim of the project was about understanding the core concepts of Python and Machine learning 


### Inspiration behind the project :
 
A lifelong goal of many Indians is homeownership. Although homeownership is high in the India today, it is changing now. 
Historically, families either needed to build their own homes or buy it from someone else. 
While both building a house and buying house have their financial advantages, owning a home isn't right for everyone. 
The problem starts with down payment which is a huge investment and not everyone can afford that. 
Another thing to look for is, buying a house is expensive in itself plus you also need to invest in furniture and other Amenities, maintenance cost etc. 
Also once you buy the house you are stuck to that place for a long time, which means you lose the ability to move to different place and explore them. 
Property values go up and down, and while this may affect homeowners in a big way, Owning a home might be beneficial for homeowners over the long run. 
However, for those who are looking to avoid the hassles of homeownership, the costs of maintenance, and the property taxes, is Renting a place as an option better?

If yes can then the first thing that comes to mind is how much will be the Rent of a place with xyz feature ?
And so we came up with a model with the help of machine learning that predicts the rent of a place given xyz features...

### summary of the process
-	Data was scrapped from https://www.magicbricks.com/
-	Data was imported using pandas 
- Data was then cleaned as some part of the data was in  unclear text format 
-	Missing values were imputed 
-	Outliers were detected and removed 
-	Exploratory Data analysis was done on the clean Data and graphs were drawn 
-	Next One hot encoding was done 
-	Data was split into training and testing data 
-	Different models were built by using different algorithm 
-	Final model was selected based on R-square score  and RMSE
